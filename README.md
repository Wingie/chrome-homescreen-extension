# Google Chrome Homescreen Extension

This extension overwrites the new tab page of the Google Chrome Browser.

On the new tab page the latest closed tabs & some favorite bookmarks are shown.

I know that there are already some extensions for this, but I couldn't find an open-source solution with a great design.

Screen solutions up to 1900x1200 are supported.


## Installation

You can install the extension directly from the Google Gallery:

## Favorite Bookmarks

The bookmarks shown are taken from the bookmark menu. If they are in no folder they are shown.
