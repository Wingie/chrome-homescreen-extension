# Google Chrome Homescreen Extension

This extension overwrites the new tab page of the Google Chrome Browser.
On the new tab page the latest closed tabs & some favorite bookmarks are shown.

I know that there are already some extensions for this, but I couldn't find an open-source solution with a great design.

Screen resolutions up to 1900x1200 are supported.


## Installation

1. Download /chrome-homescreen-extension dir to local disc
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Click "Load unpacked extensions"
4. Select the src dir you downloaded

There is no packed version available right now, but I am working on one.


## Favorite Bookmarks

The bookmarks shown are taken from the bookmark menu. If they are in no folder they are shown.
