# Google Chrome Homescreen Extension

This extension overwrites the new tab page of the Google Chrome Browser.
On the new tab page the latest closed tabs & some favorite bookmarks are shown.
I know that there are already some extensions for this, but I couldn't find an open-source solution with a great design.

Screen resolutions up to 1900x1200 are supported.
